# AirlineDatabase
Airline Database with SQLServer

1. Write down the appropriate SQL scripts (DDL statements) for creating the database and its
relational model. You can select any of the DBMS you wish.
2. Populate the database you just created again using SQL script file loaded with sample tuples.
(The tables should have enough number of tuples for the SELECT statements, asked in the
5th step, to be run accordingly.)
3. Write down 5 triggers. Triggers should be meaningful.
4. Write down 5 check constraints. Check constraints should be meaningful.
5. Write down the following SQL statements:
a. Write sample INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE statements for 5 of the tables you
choose.
b. Write 10 SELECT statements for the database you have implemented.
i. 3 of them should use minimum 2 tables.
ii. 4 of them should use minimum 3 tables.
iii. 3 of them should use minimum 4 tables.
c. Write 4 SELECT statements to exemplify nested and/or correlated nested queries.
d. Write 2 SELECT statements to exemplify EXISTS and NOT EXISTS statements.
e. Write 3 SELECT statements to exemplify LEFT, RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOIN
statements.
6. Create 5 views that are reasonable.
